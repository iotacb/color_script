# color_script
A small batch script to change the windows selection color (Mouse and Text selections)

It works by editing some registry entries.
Before changing something a backup file will be created in the current working directory.

## Usage
Just run the script, you will be asked for your wanted color (RGB color space).
If nothing is entered the script will default to a green color.

## Note
You have to restart your system to make the changes take effect.
